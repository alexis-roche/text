\begin{abstract}
This note revisits the concept of composite likelihood from the perspective of probabilistic inference, and advocates a machine learning approach to tune the associated ``weights'', which stems naturally from a connection with the maximum entropy principle: the predictive distribution that maximizes conditional entropy relative to a given prior and subject to multiple mean log-likelihood constraints is, up to a normalizing factor, the prior multiplied by a particular composite likelihood function, hence providing a ``composite'' extension of Bayes rule. We argue that composite Bayesian inference is a middle way between generative and discriminative approaches to statistical inference, which can be powerful in shallow learning and transfer learning problems.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Frequentist and Bayesian inference are based on the concept of likelihood, which relies on the existence of a statistical data-generating model that is both experimentally plausible and computationally tractable. Because this is challenging for complex data, other paradigms are commonly used in applied science: deliberately misspecified generative models, as in quasi-likelihood methods \cite{White-82,Walker-13} or na\"ive Bayes \cite{Ng-01}; minimum description length \cite{Grunwald-07}; and, last but not least, discriminative models\footnote{A {\em discriminative} model describes the conditional distribution of an unobserved variable of interest given an observable variable, in contrast with a {\em generative} model, which describes the conditional distribution of an observable variable given an unobserved variable.}, which currently dominate the field of artificial intelligence and typically require heavily supervised learning -- these include classical techniques such as maximum entropy classifiers \cite{BergerA-96}, support vector machines \cite{Vapnik-00}, Gaussian processes \cite{Rasmussen-06}, as well as most of deep learning \cite{Lecun-15,Goodfellow-16}.

A strong limitation of discriminative models is that they are not suitable for unsupervised learning or on-the-fly parameter elimination because they treat the data and the model parameters as marginally independent, meaning that the data conveys no information about the parameters if the variable of interest is not observed. This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:graph_comparison} by the respective oriented graph representations of generative and discriminative models. Due to the relative inefficiency of parameter estimation, discriminative models also tend to be outperformed by generative models in supervised learning tasks from small training sets \cite{Ng-01}. Pure discriminative models are thus of little use outside the context of big labeled data.

Composite likelihood (CL, see \cite{Varin-11} and the references therein) is a semi-generative approach to statistical inference that extends the familiar notion of likelihood without requiring a full generative model. The key idea is to model an arbitrary set of low-dimensional features separately and then combine them, instead of modeling the data distribution as a whole. This may be viewed as a ``divide and conquer'' method to approximate the true but intractable likelihood. While maximum CL does not inherit the general property of maximum likelihood to yield an asymptotically minimum-variance estimator, it is consistent under mild regularity conditions \cite{Xu-11} and may offer an excellent trade-off between computational and statistical efficiency in practice. 

In this note, CL is interpreted as a probabilistic opinion pool of ``agents'' making use of several pieces of information, or clues, extracted from the input data. Each agent acts as an isolated generative model-based statistician and expresses an opinion based on a single clue in the form of a likelihood function of the hidden variables. The agent opinions are then aggregated into a unique probability distribution analogous to a Bayesian posterior.

We further argue that a particular log-linear opinion pool yields the best possible predictive distribution in the sense of maximum relative conditional entropy. This perspective entails a method to tune the weights of the different agents from training data as in a typical discriminative learning scenario.


\section{Composite likelihood as opinion pooling}
\label{sec:pool}

Let $Y$ an observable multivariate random variable with sampling distribution $p(y|x)$ conditional on some unobserved variable of interest, $X\in{\cal X}$, where ${\cal X}$ is a known set. Given an experimental outcome $y$, the likelihood is the sampling distribution evaluated at $y$, seen as a function of $x$:
$$
L(x) = p(y|x)
.
$$

This requires a plausible generative model which, for complex data, may be out of reach or involve too many parameters to be estimated. A natural workaround known as {\em data reduction} is to extract some lower-dimensional representation $z=f(y)$, where $f$ is a many-to-one mapping, and consider the potentially more convenient likelihood function:
$$
\ell(x) = p(z|x)
.
$$

Substituting $L(x)$ with $\ell(x)$ boils down to restricting the sample space, thereby  ``delegating'' statistical inference to an ``agent'' provided with partial information. While it is valid for such an agent observing~$z$ only to consider $\ell(x)$ as the likelihood function of the problem, the drawback is that $\ell(x)$ might yield too vague a prediction of~$X$ due to the information loss incurred by data reduction. To make the trick statistically more efficient, we may extract several features, $z_i=f_i(y)$ for $i=1,2,\ldots,n$, and try to combine the likelihood functions $\ell_i(x) = p(z_i|x)$ that they elicit.

If we see the likelihoods as posterior distributions corresponding to uniform priors, this is a classical problem of probabilistic opinion aggregation from possibly redundant sources, for which several methods exist in the literature \cite{Tarantola-82,Genest-86,Garg-04,Allard-12}. We will show in Section~\ref{sec:maxent} that one that is particularly well-suited to our case is the {\em log-linear opinion pool}: 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:log_pool}
p_\lambda(x|y) = \frac{1}{Z_\lambda(y)} \pi(x) \prod_{i=1}^n p(z_i|x)^{\lambda_i},
\end{equation} 
where $\pi(x)$ is some reference distribution or prior, and $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n)$ is a vector of weights so that the normalizing factor:
$$
Z_\lambda(y) = \int \pi(x) \prod_{i=1}^n p(z_i|x)^{\lambda_i} dx
$$
is finite, which holds whenever $\lambda\succeq 0$, {\em i.e.} all weights are positive, assuming that the agent opinions are always upper bounded. Negative weights should be ruled out as the existence condition $Z_\lambda(y)<\infty$ would then depend on the particular opinions expressed by the agents. Also note that, while it is possible to have the weights depend on~$y$, there is a strong rational for constant weights as we shall see in the sequel. 

%Strictly positive weights guarantee the so-called 0/1 forcing property, that is, if an hypothesis~$x$ has zero likelihood according to at least one agent, then its consensus probability vanishes too.

% Not clear yet as to what a negative weight could mean!

The log-linear pool~(\ref{eq:log_pool}) bears a striking similarity to Bayes rule, yielding the form: $p_\lambda(x|y)\propto \pi(x) L^c_\lambda(x)$, where the quantity:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:comp_lik}
L^c_\lambda(x) \equiv \prod_{i=1}^n \ell_i (x)^{\lambda_i}
\end{equation} 
plays the same role as a traditional likelihood function. This expression happens to be known in statistics as a {\em marginal composite likelihood} \cite{Varin-11}. See Appendix~\ref{sec:conditional} for the slightly more general form called {\em conditional composite likelihood}, which can be derived in the same way.

From~(\ref{eq:comp_lik}), we see that CL shares a convenient factorized form with the likelihood derived under the assumption of mutual feature independence, usually referred to as {\em na\"ive Bayes} or {\em simple Bayes} in the machine learning literature, which corresponds to the special case of unitary weights, $\lambda_1=\ldots=\lambda_n= 1$. The clear computational advantage of CL over the true likelihood is that it only requires to evaluate the marginal feature distributions rather than the joint distribution of all features.


\section{Classical tuning of composite likelihood weights}

When the features can be considered {\em exchangeable}, it is natural to choose uniform CL weights. The CL function is then a scaled version of the na\"ive Bayes likelihood, the common weight value being irrelevant to the maximum CL estimator (MCLE). The weight may be tuned so as to best adjust the pseudo posterior variance matrix to the asymptotic variance matrix of the MCLE \cite{Pauli-11}, or via a close-in-spirit curvature adjustment \cite{Ribatet-12}, in attempts to match the frequentist and composite Bayesian notions of uncertainty.

Ignoring such a goal, another frequent recommandation for CL weights is to sum up to one. This can be motivated in various ways. It turns out that the only pooling operator that does not explicitly depend on~$x$ and preserves {\em external Bayesianity} is the log-linear opinion pool with unit sum weights \cite{Genest-86b}. External Bayesianity essentially means that it should not matter whether the prior is incorporated before or after pooling, provided that all agents agree on the same prior. Another appealing property of log-linear pooling with unit sum weights is to minimize the average Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the agent opinions \cite{Garg-04}. A maximum relative entropy property is also given in \cite{Wang-14}, Theorem~3.

Unit sum weights, however, correspond to the extreme situation where the features are assumed to be maximally redundant, but is clearly ineffective for independent or weakly correlated features, which require weights close to one for the CL to closely approximate the true likelihood. In this case, the CL may be much flatter than it should, leading to severly overestimated credibility sets.

{\color{red} Why is it important to fine-tune the weights?}
We therefore need a method to tune weights that can automatically adjust to the level of statistical dependence beween features.

%Instead, redundancy between agents is assumed by default, and is effectively encoded by the unit sum constraint on weights\footnote{Nevertheless, features which are {\em known} to be mutually independent can be merged into a single feature. This results in increasing their weights in the log-linear pool.}.



\section{Maximum entropy derivation of composite likelihood}
\label{sec:maxent}

The coordinator discards the priors used by the agents. 

A cheap MaxEnt argument was already given by \cite{Wang-14}. $I$-projection onto a set of predictive distributions compatible with mean log-likelihood contraints. If I know the generative distribution, I know the expected log-likelihood.

Intuition behind weights: Lagrange multipliers to enforce a constraint... Notion of feature relevance. but is there some intuition behind that? 

BTW, we can work with inequality constraints to force $\lambda\geq 0$:
$$
E[\log \ell_i(x)] \geq \bar{\ell}_i
$$

What does the constraint mean? It means that a model is admissible if it compresses the data at least as well as all my agents.

Game theoretic interpretation \cite{Grunwald-04}.

% Accounting here for Xi'An comment on xianblog.wordpress.com
% The sum of the powers is constrained to be equal to one, even though
% I do not understand why the dimensions of the projections play nog
% role in this constraint. Simplicity is advanced as an argument,
% which sounds rather weak…
%This simple constraint is implied by the external Bayesianity requirement: as it turns out, the only aggregation operator which is both externally Bayesian and independent from $x$ boils down to plugging a composite likelihood with unit sum weights into Bayes rule, hence extending the classical notion of likelihood in Bayesian analysis.


\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

{\color{red}Product of fucking experts \cite{Hinton-02}. Log-linear pool to build a generative model (assuming in fact independence between experts). Better seen as a ``log-mixture model''. Sounds like each expert is associated with a class, so it's the same as a RBM. Contrastive learning approximates ML parameter estimation. The experts are learning jointly. It's just a generative model.}

{\color{red}Boosting.}

CL is a concept from computational statistics that has mainly been developed so far in a frequentist perspective as a surrogate for the maximum likelihood method. In this paper, we have shown (to our best knowledge, for the first time) a deep connection between CL and  probabilistic opinion pooling, thereby establishing CL as a class of discriminative models. 

Any CL~model is fully determined by the marginal generative distributions of some pre-specified features, which may rely on a moderate number of parameters if low-dimensional features are chosen. There are two approaches to deal with these parameters.

One is to estimate them beforehand by supervised learning, if an adequate training dataset is available. This could be compared with contrastive pre-training of RBMs \cite{Hinton-06,Fischer-14}, which also optimizes parameters for generation of observable features. An important difference, however, is that contrastive pre-training is unsupervised. On the other hand, SCL pre-training relies on weaker assumptions as it does not assume conditional feature independence unlike RBMs. Once pre-training is complete, the SCL~weights may be tuned by maximum~SCL, as shown in Section~\ref{sec:weights}: this second training stage is, again, supervised in essence, but does not require additional training examples since it is fully determined by the feature distributions learned in the pre-training step.

%{\color{red} Moreover, while RBM parameters are typically refined in a supervised discriminative learning step, disjoint set of parameters for SCL. Dunno how to say that.} 

%In such context, SCL competes with classical discriminative models (logistic regression, Gaussian processes \cite{Rasmussen-06}, maximum entropy models \cite{BergerA-96}, etc.), and may compare more or less favorably in practice depending on the amount of training data. For relatively small training datasets, we may hope for more accurate inference using~SCL than using traditional discriminative models, extrapolating from the results of \cite{Ng-01} regarding the comparison between logistic regression and na\"ive Bayes classifiers.
%{\color{red}Ici, il manque la comparaison avec les RBMs qui ne sont pas (forcement) des modeles discriminatifs.}

%%, hence alleviating the need for heavily supervised model training

The other approach to deal with feature distribution parameters is to consider them as nuisance parameters, as proposed in Section~\ref{sec:nuisance_params}, thereby avoiding pre-training. The method then becomes completely unsupervised. The weights can be tuned by maximizing the log-SCL integrated over the prior on nuisance parameters (see Section~\ref{sec:nuisance_weights}), which requires no training dataset whatsoever, and the nuisance parameters can be eliminated by substituting the~SCL function with a {\em super composite evidence} (see Section~\ref{sec:nuisance_integration}). In this version, SCL~essentially generalizes Bayesian integration. 

The potential of SCL for unsupervised learning is perhaps suprising considering that it is a discriminative model. This stems from the fact that, unlike classical discriminative models, SCL~exploits direct information conveyed by the data about both the parameters of interest and the nuisance parameters, reflecting the generative nature of the underlying feature distribution models. This essential difference is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:dgraph}: the factor graph model underlying CL in its parametric version (see Figure~\ref{fig:fgraph5}) is not reducible to a belief network of the type represented in Figure~\ref{fig:dgraph2}, in which the data and the nuisance parameter are marginally independent. In contrast, the data is informative about the nuisance parameter in a CL model, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dgraph3}.


In summary, CL has the potential to yield weakly supervised or unsupervised Bayesian-like inference procedures depending on the particular task at hand. This property reflects the encoding of statistical relationships between the data and {\em all} unknown parameters. CL thus appears as a trade-off between generative models, which are optimal for unsupervised learning but possibly intractable, and traditional discriminative models (logistic regression, Gaussian processes \cite{Rasmussen-06}, maximum entropy models \cite{BergerA-96}, etc.), which are inherently supervised. CL models are discriminative models assembled from atomic generative models and, from this point of view, may be considered as {\em semi-generative} models.



%CL may be considered as a {\em semi-generative} model: a discriminative model assembled from partial generative models.

%As a note of caution, we shall stress that the pre-determined weights assigned to the different associations between observed and unobserved values represent prior knowledge regarding the informativeness of clues. A poor choice of weights will inevitably result in a poor approximation to the ``true'' Bayesian posterior -- the posterior that would be obtained from a realistic generative model if it was tractable. In future work, we will investigate feature selection strategies to mitigate this problem.

% ** Why is it compatible with unsupervised learning? Give more insight.
% ** Stress the contribution: class-specific weighting.
% * Pivotality argument.
% * Bayes is a special case of composite Bayes.

\appendix

\section{Conditional composite likelihood}
\label{sec:conditional}

As a straightforward  extension of marginal CL, each feature-based likelihood $\ell_i(x)=p(z_i|x)$ may be conditioned by an additional ``independent'' feature $z^c_i = f^c_i(y)$ considered as a predictor of the ``dependent'' feature, $z_i=f_i(y)$, yielding the more general form:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cond_feat_lik}
\ell_i(x) = p(z_i|x,z^c_i).
\end{equation}

Conditioning may be useful if it is believed that $z^c_i$ alone is little or not informative about $x$, but can provide relevant information when considered jointly with $x$, as in the case of regression covariates, for instance. Equation~(\ref{eq:comp_lik}) then amounts to conditional CL \cite{Varin-11}, a more general form of CL also including Besag's historical {\em pseudo-likelihood} \cite{Besag-74} developed for image segmentation.


\section{Minimally discriminative model}

Let $\pi(x)$ some reference distribution that represents full
uncertainty about $X$. We wish to select the joint distribution
$p(x,y)$ that minimizes:
$$
I(p) = \int p(x,y) \log \frac{p(x|y)}{\pi(x)} dy,
$$ subject to feature mean-value constraints of the form:
$$
\int p(x,y) f(x,y) dx dy = \mu.
$$

There are two special cases of this problem in the literature.  On the
one hand, the {\em maximum entropy classifier} \cite{BergerA-96}
incorporates the constraint that $p(y)$ be known, however we will see
that this is not necessary. The {\em minimally informative likelihood}
method \cite{Yuan-99b,Yuan-99}, on the other hand, imposes that
$p(x)=\pi(x)$, hence assuming the form $p(x,y)=\pi(x)p(y|x)$. We won't
make such assumptions here and will consider the case where $\mu$ is
completely unknown.

The above problem is seen to be equivalent to minimizing the auxiliary
objective function:
$$
I(p,m) 
= \int p(x,y) \log \frac{p(x,y)}{\pi(x)m(y)} dxdy,
$$ over $p$ and $m$, subject to the same constraints on $p$. We note
that $I(p,m)=I(p)+D(p_y\|m)$, showing that the auxiliary function
essentially adds a penalty term to the actual objective in order to
force $p(y)$ close to $m(y)$.

Minimizing $I(p,m)$ along both $p$ and $m$ is basically a minimum KL
divergence problem between two convex distribution spaces, so there
must be a unique solution {\bf -- to be checked in
  \cite{Cover-91}}. It is similar to the rate-distortion problem in
information theory, which may be solved by alternate minimization,
yielding a Blahut-Arimoto algorithm.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Let's call it A-step}. Optimize $p(x,y)$ at fixed $m$
  s.t. constraint:
$$
\exists \lambda, \qquad
p_{\lambda,m}(x,y) = \frac{1}{Z(\lambda, m)} \pi(x) m(y) e^{-\lambda^\top t(x,y)}
$$
The actual $\lambda$ is found my maximizing the dual function
$\psi(\lambda,m)$, see below.
\item {\em Let's call it B-step}. Optimize $m(y)$ at fixed $p(x,y)$:
$$
m(y) = \int p(x,y) dx
$$
\end{itemize}

Upon convergence, the algorithm outputs both joint and marginal
distributions $p_{\star}(x,y)$ and $m_{\star}(y)$ that both depend on
$\mu$. By construction, we have that $p_{\star}(y) = m_{\star}(y)$,
therefore $p_\star(x|y)=p_{\star}(x,y)/m_{\star}(y)$.


\section{Comparison with maximum entropy classifier}

Lagrangian...
$$
{\cal L}(p,m,\lambda)
= 
\int p(x,y) \log \frac{p(x,y)}{\pi(x)m(y)} dxdy
+
\lambda^\top \left( 
\int p(x,y) f(x,y) dydy - \mu 
\right)
$$ where $\lambda$ represents a vector-valued Lagrange multiplier. At
fixed $m$, the solution has the form:
$$
p_{\lambda,m}(x,y) = \frac{1}{Z(\lambda,m)}
\pi(x) m(y) e^{-\lambda^\top f(x,y)} 
$$

Note that this implies that the conditional distribution is
independent of $m$ once $\lambda$ is determined,
$$
p_\lambda(x|y) = \frac{1}{z(\lambda,y)} \pi(x) e^{-\lambda^\top f(x,y)} 
$$

Also, the marginal is a modulation of $m(y)$:
$$
p_{\lambda,m}(y) = \frac{z(\lambda,y)}{Z(\lambda,m)} m(y)
$$

Dual function at fixed $m$:
$$
\psi(\lambda,m) 
\equiv \min_p {\cal L}(p,m,\lambda)
= 
- \log Z(\lambda,m) - \lambda^\top \mu
.
$$ 

An alternative expression is:
$$
\psi(\lambda, m)
= 
\int h(x,y) 
\log \frac{p_{\lambda,m}(x,y)}{\pi(x)m(y)} dxdy,
$$ where $h(x,y)$ is any distribution statisfying the
constraints. This shows that maximizing the dual function at fixed $m$
is essentially the same as minimizing the KL divergence
$D(h\|p_{\lambda,m})$ over $\lambda$, in other words fitting $h(x,y)$
by some distribution of the form $p_{\lambda,m}$. The fact that the
result does not depend on the particular $h(x,y)$ that is chosen, as
long as it satifies the constraint, is a general property of
exponential families.

We also have that the dual function associated with $I(p)$ reads:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\psi(\lambda) 
 & = & \min_m \psi(\lambda, m)\\
 & = & \int h(x,y) \log \frac{p_{\lambda}(x|y)}{\pi(x)} dxdy\\
 & = & -\int h(y) \log z(\lambda,y) dy - \lambda^\top \mu
\end{eqnarray*}

But, wait, that's exactly what we get in the maximum entropy
classifier! So, at the end of the day, we simply got an alternative
method to learn $\lambda$ in the maximum entropy classifier, i.e. the
Blahut-Arimoto algorithm as opposed to a brute-force maximization of
$\psi(\lambda)$. Both methods will converge to the same $\lambda$...

What it essentially means is that the optimal $\lambda$ is insensitive
to $m(y)$ as long as $m(y)$ is compliant in the sense that:
$$
m(y) = \int h(x,y) dx,
$$ for some distribution $h(x,y)$ statisfying the constraint. This is
true for the optimal $m_\star(y)$ output by the BA algorithm, but
also, for instance, for the empirical distribution of observations in
a training dataset used to estimate $\mu$, as proposed in
\cite{BergerA-96}. The only special property of $m_\star(y)$ is to
yield the full Bayesian model $p_\star(x,y)=p_\star(x|y)m_\star(y)$
that minimizes the discrimination information. We may not care too
much about that in practice since we will only use $p_\star(x|y)$. 

\section{Comparison with minimally informative likelihood}

Yuan \cite{Yuan-99} considered the situation where we add the
constraint that $p(x)=\pi(x)$ to the minimum discrimination inference
problem. Unknown is then the conditional distribution
$p(y|x)$. Lagrangian...
\begin{eqnarray*}
{\cal L}(p,m,\lambda)
 & = & 
\int \pi(x)p(y|x) \log \frac{p(y|x)}{m(y)} dxdy
+
\lambda^\top \left( 
\int \pi(x)p(y|x) f(x,y) dydy - \mu 
\right) \\
 & = & 
\int \pi(x)
\left( 
\int
p(y|x) \log \frac{p(y|x)}{m(y)} dy
+
\lambda^\top 
\int p(y|x) f(x,y) dy
- \mu 
\right)
dx 
\end{eqnarray*}

The derivative is given by,
$$
\frac{\partial\cal L}{\partial p(y|x)}
= 
\pi(x)\left[ 
1 + \log \frac{p(y|x)}{m(y)} 
+ \lambda^\top f(x,y)
\right],
$$
hence the optimal model at fixed $m$ has the form:
$$
p_{\lambda,m}(y|x) = \frac{1}{Z(\lambda,m,x)} m(y) e^{-\lambda^\top f(x,y)} 
$$

Note that the induced posterior distribution $p_{\lambda,m}(x|y)$ has
a different form from above unless the normalizing factor
$Z(\lambda,m,x)$ turns out independent from $x$. If this is not the
case, we no longer have the property that $p_{\lambda,m}(x|y)$ is
independent from $m$ given $\lambda$.

Dual function...
$$
\psi(\lambda,m) 
=
- \int \pi(x) \log Z(\lambda, m, x) dx
- \lambda^\top \mu
$$

Equivalently, for any distribution under the form $\pi(x)h(y|x)$ that
satisfies the moment constraint, we have:
$$
\psi(\lambda,m) 
=
\int \pi(x) h(y|x) \log \frac{p_{\lambda,m}(y|x)}{m(y)} dxdy
$$

Now, the real question is why should we constrain $p(x)$, which boils
down to a Bayesian prior in this context, to be the same as our
reference $\pi(x)$? It only makes sense if we want our inference to
stick to a generative modeling paradigm... but haven't we already
given up on that? Therefore, unless we find a good reason not to, we
won't impose the $p(x)=\pi(x)$ constraint, thereby allowing for a
discrepancy between the reference and the prior.


\section{Discriminative vs. semi-discriminative}

Let's go back to the equivalence we found between our approach and the
maximum entropy classifier (MCE) \cite{BergerA-96}. We have said that
the former is essentially a re-formulation of MCE.

But the re-formulation also conveys a generalization of MCE if,
instead of letting $m$ being an arbitrary distribution, we restrict
its search space to some set of acceptable reference
distributions. Would such a strategy be useful? 

Recall that the method selects the joint distribution that minimizes
discriminative information, as defined by $I(p)$:
$$
I(p) 
= \int p(x,y)\log\frac{p(x|y)}{\pi(x)} dxdy
= E_Y[D(p_{x|y}\|\pi)]
$$

The latter characterization reminds us that discriminative information
is defined in an average sense. The corresponding posterior $p(x|y)$
may not be conservative for some $y$, in particular those that are
unlikely under $p(y)$. It would be a problem if that's the case for
the particular data at hand. For that to happen rarely, the ideal
$p(y)$ would be the ``true'' marginal distribution of $Y$.

However, for vague mean value constraints, nothing may prevent the
optimal $m_\star(y)$ from departing significantly from that ideal
distribution. In fact, we can show that $m_\star(y)$ only has mass at
$y$ values that maximize $z(\lambda_\star,y)$, and is therefore likely
sparse. This is because $m_\star$ minimizes $\psi(\lambda_\star,m)$,
which is equivalent to maximizing $Z(\lambda_\star,m)$ and we have:
$$
Z(\lambda, m) = \int m(y) z(\lambda, y) dy.
$$

In other words, the solution to our problem may be singular! It does
not hurt since, as discussed above, one may alternatively fix $m(y)$
to some pre-defined distribution... but this, in practice, restricts
the method to supervised learning situations.

We may not face this issue with the MIL method, which further imposes
the prior on $X$, so all the information from the constraints goes
into specifying a possibly reasonable generative model.
