I am confused about the "Tapas posh esplanade photo"... The Frog's BRT picture looks identical to a picture found on the Flash PT website, allegedly uploaded in May 2017:

as you already acknowledged in a previous comment, Textusa 1 Nov 2018, 11:05:00, in response to Ben Salmon.

I fail to understand why you rule out that the Frog simply found that picture searching the internet (or was directed to it by someone who searched the internet). I must be missing something...

To see if it would be easy to find that picture, I just did a Google image search using your screengrab from the CMTV 2013 documentary as a target (https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QF6IkeiM40U/W9ih5nq6U1I/AAAAAAAAQ1M/5w8D_TIXQXw684rnh4NhvRRcEBdLHbiQwCLcBGAs/s400/CMTV%2BBRT.jpg)

Google images returned twelve URLs, the first three of which directly link to the Flash high-res picture:

https://www.flash.pt/atualidade/mundo/detalhe/maddie-e-os-irmaos-estariam-drogados

So it seems to me that anyone who would have attempted a similar search after May 2017 would have stood a good chance to find the "posh esplanade photo"... Perhaps naive from me, so please point me to where I am wrong. Or has the Frog produced another picture? Hopefully, I am not your only reader struggling with this issue.

I am also still not clear why the Frog tried to use the photo against the blog (desperation? Kamikaze attack?) but that's a completely different question.

Could you please recap why you think the picture was handed in to the Frog by a
