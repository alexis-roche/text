Just an hypothesis, but what if the "third option" was the goal of Operation Grange from the beginning? In 2011, the UK government realized that the official abduction theory had lost too much credibility due, in particular, to the wide awareness of the sniffer dog evidence. They might then have appointed SY to come up with a new theory accounting for the dog markings, with the intent to put an end to the Maddie media frenzy. To be "minimally inconvenient", the new theory would have to be a mere update to the 2007 abduction scenario, in which no protagonist was seriously compromised. The only realistic solution fulfilling this constraint was to have Maddie killed in the apartment, then taken, by a mysterious intruder.


The extreme slowness of Operation Grange suggests that SY met more difficulties than expected in completing this task. Perhaps the Portuguese authorities were not happy about the proposed scenario. Perhaps the activity on the blogosphere (also partly revived by the launching of Operation Grange) raised some concern. But October 2013 BBC Crimewatch was quite clear that SY were not up for the truth. It rather proved their determination to manipulate opinion in the crudest way with the Cr√®che Dad fabrication, although they did subtly leave the door open to Amaral's "minimalist" theory - body concealment by the McCanns alone - maybe the "B plan"?


Who knows what SY are up to at the moment. As pointed out in the post, time is not a friend of third option when it comes to biology, but time may tire many of the beautiful souls eager for truth and justice, thereby increasing the chances of promoting abduction 2.0 in the long run. This might be the current strategy: attrition warfare. To just let all of us get tired and give up.


I hope to be wrong on this. That would mean that we still need to be very, very patient to see the truth prevailing one day.
