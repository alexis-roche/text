I got that idea from the sentence: "Searches of squares contaminated with the scent of the control (alive) subjects, ilicited no signals from any of the cadaver dogs".

What can this mean other than saying that the dogs signaled either samples contaminated by cadaver (true positives) or uncontaninated samples, but no sample contaminated by living person? Please explain.

I thought the debate with Insane was about what the paper calls "control", on which he is clearly wrong, but I believe he is right about the above - unless I misread the sentence, or the whole paper.

Besides, the doubt I raised is about the relevance of the 3 false positives in the 'Uncontaminated or contaminated by living/false positive' line of Table 1, for the reasons that I have tried to explain. It is not a doubt about the dog's reliability, much to the contrary.
