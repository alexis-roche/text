On the other hand, it's pretty encouraging to see several fake antis (not saying you are one of them) announcing the end of OG and whinning about it in a coordinated way as it makes it sound more like a new "line to take" than a reality. 

For instance, when Blacksmith has a fictional "Conspiracy Nutter" say that "OG has been secretly killed off", doesn't it feel like Blacksmith is trying to convince people who don't trust him that OG has indeed been secretly killed off?

I find encouraging their need to discourage us, online truth seekers, but that's only my opinion of course.
