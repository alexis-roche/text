I don't want to sound like I am trying to defend the French media. Generally speaking, I think that they have been appalling in the Maddie case (that obviously includes Karl ZÃ©ro and his empty TV program on "13e rue" back in october 2007 - but what do you expect from someone who is not even a journalist?).

I only pointed out some facts showing that the French media did not collaborate 100% on the hoax. I also believe that the Portuguese media played a key role to prevent the truth from being buried forever, despite also being filled with fake news.

No question that we were all failed (and many were actually fooled) by the worldwide MSM in the Maddie case. I guess that is the reason why we are here today.
