I do hope that you are right about Gemma Oâ€™Doherty being absolutely independent. If so, her investigation can only serve the Truth. However, so few journalists have shown independence in the Maddie case that it might be preferable to remain agnostic on this matter until we get to know more from Mrs O'Doherty.
