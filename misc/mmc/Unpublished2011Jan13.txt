Censored comment on joana-morais (13/1/11)


An involvement of the pharmaceutical industry is plausible in the light of the fact that the PJ has never been granted access to Madeleine's medical records. Was that to conceal leads to some kind of dubious medication?


Also, it is worthwhile taking a look at this excerpt from the Madeleine Foundation's letter to David Cameron in October 2010
(http://www.mccannfiles.com/id338.html):


"[...] it is understood that one of the major investors in the FSS, who, we are informed, did the analysis of the DNA and other evidence in the Madeleine McCann investigation, is a company called 3i. It is understood that 3i is a private equity company with strong links to both Brian Kennedy and Control Risks Group, a company brought in to Praia da Luz in the first days after Madeleine McCann was reported missing and whose role in the matter has been very obscure. We understand that the major shareholder in Control Risks Group is 3i Equity plc, and that the Chairman of 3i is Baroness Sarah Hogg, sister-in-law of Mrs Justice Hogg who of course was the judge who made Madeleine McCann a Ward of the High Court 19 days after she was reported missing."
