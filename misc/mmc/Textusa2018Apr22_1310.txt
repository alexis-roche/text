What is xenophobic in stating the obvious fact that the British authorities forced the Portuguese justice into the abduction scenario? Please watch again the media conference of British Ambassador John Buck on May 4 2007, in the hours following the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. Watch it again and again. Doesn't it say very clearly that UK considered abduction as the only acceptable line of inquiry? Wasnâ€™t that an official statement that anyone who would lie in favor of the abduction scenario would be placed under the protection of UK?
