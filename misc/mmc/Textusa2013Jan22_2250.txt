About CM becoming the McCanns' spokesman on Sep 17, 2007, I read that in Wikipedia:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann

They cite the following article as their source (unfortunately I cannot access it):

David Brown and Steve Bird (17 September 2007). "Portuguese judge balks at ordering Madeleine McCann's parents to return". The Times (London).

You may have spotted it already. I am afraid I don't have more references for now.
