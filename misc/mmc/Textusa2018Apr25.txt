Please let me ask you some questions so I can make sense of the "precis".

How do you explain the dog alerts in the car rented three weeks later?

"Simple and expedient" disposal, "no movement at a later date": why then was the body never found in your opinion?

What do you think were the reasons for the UK government to interfere with the investigation (unless you don't believe such interference occurred)?
