Gemma O'Doherty has twitted that Maddie was "failed utterly" by the police. It looks like Gon√ßalo Amaral agrees with that according to an interview he gave to CM last year:

These words about the direction of PJ seem particularly relevant:

"You do not get rid of a senior police officer to defend a couple suspected at the very least of child neglect, which led to the disappearance. It was almost a lack of respect to make the decision that it was an abduction and make it public. That was not looking at the investigation objectively. If this investigation ever comes to an end and if it proves that the parents have nothing to do with the case, that's fine."
