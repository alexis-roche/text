Thank you for your answers to my questions.

I am not sure what you mean by: "the body became undifferentiated very soon after the "discovery"". My understanding of your theory on the body disposal is that a very distressed Gerry decided to take dead Maddie to the streets of PdL with the intent to throw her at sea. I assume that he knew that the body would likely be found in the following days, but the autopsy would not rule out murder by a fictional abductor. Gerry on his way to the beach does nothing to avoid crossing with the Smith family, then feels some sort of panic, decides to throw his daughter in a trash bin, and quickly returns to OC. The body is taken by the garbage collectors next day or so, and incinerated without anyone noticing. Am I understanding correctly?

Regarding the political role of UK, basically you are saying that the case has been deadlocked for 11 years because some high-ranking British leaders were initially fooled by the abduction staging and could not admit it. Correct too?
