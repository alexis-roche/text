Happy New Year Textusa!

There may be another problem with the 2-rat meal (or the additional 7-rat variant) which feels to me like a rather major objection: how about the cadaver scent in the car boot?

You may say that it's not an issue because the general public has already been made to doubt the sniffer dog's reliability and/or to buy the rotten meat story told by the McCanns (or other excuses that I am not aware of). From a pure logical perspective, I would agree with that: if you didn't believe in the sniffer dogs while you thought that the McCanns were innocent, you have no logical reason to change your mind once you are told that they are not.

However, that's pure logical thinking and it completely ignores the psychological side of things. Human psychology dictates that, as soon as the McCanns are charged, many people will inevitably start thinking that the dogs were "right", hence speculating that Maddie's body was indeed present in the car boot. Then SY have a serious problem: how could the McCanns or T9 hide the body during 3 weeks? If they are to restore their credibility, they'd better come up with a convincing explanation for that.

That's the same old problem as back in 2007 and possibly (although I know you might not exactly agree with this) the reason why the hunt was called off at the time. Would the dogs have not responded in that car, would the saga have lasted so long?

Perhaps naively, I would imagine that the problem can be solved with minimal collateral damage by adding just another rat to the lot: Murat. But the fact that it did not happen in 2007 suggests that, for some reason, it was not considered a valid option or maybe not an option at all. Is this man protected? Is he truly innocent? I have no clue, but why would have things changed in the meantime? This makes me feel a bit puzzled regarding the McCanns being brought into justice at this point.
