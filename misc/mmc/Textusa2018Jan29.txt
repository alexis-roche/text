Don’t you think that swinging was a plausible *initial* reason to simulate an abduction? The “big hitters” could have the Portuguese police under control with some appropriate political help, but what about the media? Who knows if some Portuguese journos would not find out about the swinging event and leak some names in the local press? Who is powerful enough to prevent that? Such scoop, even unlikely, would then be taken up in the UK and surely be devastating for some reputations, even more so if associated, loosely or not, with the death of a little girl, accidental or not.

In this scenario, the simulated abduction would be part of a quickly decided fallback strategy in the aftermath of Maddie’s death, the main goal of which was to exfiltrate some relevant people “incognito”. It is also possible that the McCanns accepted to play their role in the story on the promise of some kind of reward for being “helpful”, despite having *initially* nothing serious to fear on the judicial level. This would partly explain their pretty arrogant attitude.

Once the initial panic moment had passed, the motivation for the cover-up changed as a consequence of what this blog has called a “snowball effect”. With the PJ being less controllable than expected, there was some pressure to let the truth out, and that was probably possible without exposing the swinging, but not without exposing many people involved in the cover-up itself. And all this further escalated over time, with the government finally putting the whole reputation of UK on the line wth Operation Grange... Bloody dogs!

BTW, this is personal speculation. My view is clearly influenced by this blog, but may not be endorsed by the blog team.
