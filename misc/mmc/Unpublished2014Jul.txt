About negligence, a distinction should be made between "negligence" (leaving three kids unattended in a flat) and "super negligence" (leaving three kids unattended in an UNLOCKED flat). We know that neither of the two occurred, but we may ask why the "super negligence" option was chosen to support the cover-up, at the risk of exposing the McCanns as totally irresponsible parents and making the abduction story look implausible right from the beginning.


"Negligence" was necessary for an abduction to be possible, but "super negligence" was only necessary because no break-in was simulated. Without a break-in, the McCanns had to look like the light-minded parents who forget to lock their apartment when leaving with their three kids inside; they had to claim they took the longest path from Tapas to use the entrance door when doing the checks (hence failing to "notice" that the sliding windows weren't locked); and finally, they needed the abductor to accomplish the exploit of leaving through the window with a child in his arms, while he could simply have used the door otherwise.


I would imagine that smart people engaging in such a serious crime as concealing a body would be fully aware of such inconsistencies, and would do their best to avoid them. So why didn't they simulate a break-in?


This, IMO, suggests that the T9 were not in the lead on the night of Maddie's disappearance.  "Super negligence", on the other hand, preserved the higher interest of Ocean Club not to be advertised worldwide as an unsafe venue, and that seems to have counted more than the T9 credibility.
