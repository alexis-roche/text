There is some speculation that Operation Grange will end soon, or has
even already been secretly ended.

If this is true, it could be good or bad news.

The most important question is not WHEN OG will end, but HOW it will end.

OG has been going on for more than seven years now... Whether people
see it as a genuine police investigation or as a pure UK goverment PR
exercise, everyone certainly agrees that it has already lasted a long
time.

The UK government won't be able, and has probably no intent, to let OG
run for many more years. Everyone senses that OG has to stop at some
point, and sooner or later someone out there will decide that the time
has come.

OG will then have to communicate its results.

Anyone subscribing to Textusa's views on the case has no doubt
whatsoever that the UK goverment has known the truth about Maddie from
day 1. Therefore, the goal of OG could not possibly be to solve the
case

Who knows what these will be. But we can try to guess by first
answering two key questions: 1) what was the goal of OG when it was
launched by David Cameron in May 2011? 2) has this goal be re-assessed
in the meantime?


be proper Police investigation.


We can have an opinion but police need enough to satisfy the CPS but
also ticking off all the other culprits in all the other crimes...to
charge #mccann too soon could ruin the case for the fraud and
blackmail culprits
