This article is really good food for thoughts. Many thanks Textusa.

Just one question: September 17, 2007 - isn't that the precise day when Clarence Mitchell resigned as director of the Central Office of Information's media monitoring unit to become the McCanns' media spokesman. Only two weeks before GA was sacked.

Sorry if that was obvious.

Best,

Alex
