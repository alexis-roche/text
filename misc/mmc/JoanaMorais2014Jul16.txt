Guerra, you state that SY wants "to convey to the public that the original investigators were wrong when they concluded that there was no abduction". Over the past 10 months, SY has done quite some PR in conjunction with the McCanns vs Amaral trial, but not exactly to confirm the abduction scenario. To summarize:
- they trashed the Jane Tanner's bundleman sighting, the original abduction theory's cornerstone
- they emphasized the Smith sighting and published an e-fit of Smithman that everyone noticed looks like Gerry McCann
- they admitted publicly that Maddie might have died in the flat
- they made sure to be seen digging Praia da Luz for remains of a dead Maddie

So it doesn't look like they are heading to the same old abduction story that we have been fed with for seven years. What they are up to, I don't know, but they seem to be slowly preparing the public for a different story. That burglar story that the Portuguese police says was checked and dismissed a long time ago? I doubt it. As you righlty say, they know they cannot incriminate anyone without evidence. On the other hand, they are highly expected to deliver results at some point due to the huge funds engaged in the SY review. The deadline might be the next UK general election in May 2015. Quite soon from now...
