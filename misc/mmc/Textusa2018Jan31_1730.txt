Sorry, I had missed your comment of 29 Jan 2018, 12:45:00.
Now that I have read it, I understand why we do not concur.

My personal opinion (which is only an opinion since I have no link with the authors, but please consider that I have long-term experience in scientific research) is that your explanation is implausible for two reasons.

First, it would mean that the authors did not describe their experimental protocol in detail, which is not scientifically acceptable and would have prompted the reviewers to ask them to revise the paper accordingly (since this is a peer-reviewed journal).

Second, the preliminary control procedure you assume does not appear to be necessary for the sake of a statistical analysis that answers the questions the authors addressed. I very much doubt that they complexified their experimental protocol and sacrificied data (extra squares) if it was not needed.

All was needed was to include both uncontaminated samples and samples contaminated by living tissue in order to rule out the trivial concerns that dogs may respond in the absence of stimulus, or may indiferently respond to dead or live human scent. Both uncontaminated and contaminated by living samples could be considered as distinct types of "controls", this is a minor terminology issue in my opinion.
