Just as a little reminder, if you plan to go to Portugal this summer, do not forget to bring rape whistles along. Always watch out paedophiles, burglars and human trafficking gangs lurking in the street. Keep the phone numbers of some journalists to call in the very likely event that you are victim of a crime or witness one - do NOT call the police, for your own safety. However, if you plan to dine out and get hammered while leaving your kids alone in your rented flat, and are concerned that you might not find the bloody key when you come back, remember that in Portugal it is considered within the bounds of responsible parenting to leave doors unlocked in such circumstances. Enjoy your holiday!
