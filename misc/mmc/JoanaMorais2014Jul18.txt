Guerra,

Cr√®che Dad, like the three burglar story, are just PR hoaxes - totally irrelevant to a serious investigation. We agree on that. But I believe that SY are here to get closure on the case and that they can't achieve that by just running a PR campaign. That's basically why SY came into play 3 years ago. So, yes, I believe that they are running an investigation, mainly taking place in the UK, of which nothing has been disclosed yet.
