Not discussing the quality of the program, the point is that Mr Amaral was given the opportunity to expose his views on the Maddie case on a leading radio channel in a country other than Portugal, and that happened in 2009. You seem to imply that the program was aimed to discredit Amaral, I see no reason to think so.

By the way, could you be specific about the facts you say are wrong? I am not an expert on the Maddie case. The only thing that disturbed me was the suggestion that Smith came forward straight away, while we know it took days. For the rest, the story was IMO a good digest of Mr Amaral's book. Of course, negligence was promoted but that was consistent with Amaral's opinion (back in 2009, few people were challenging negligence I believe).

As a side note, I am not Doug D.
