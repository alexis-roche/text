I guess I was asking this because if I was protecting the hoax, I would really not want that particular photo to end up in Textusa's hands, would I?

The fact that no one has ever tried to use it against you, not even after the CMTV show, speaks for itself.

Well, no one until recently... But if whoever tipped the Frog about the photo is a friend of the hoax then, I would say, the hoax barely needs enemies.

Someone out there must be quite upset.
