"Since late Sept 2007, no media in the world has published anything TRUTHFUL against the McCanns, or to be precise linking the McCanns to Maddie's death, until now, in Australia."

I assume that you are you excluding the Portuguese media from this statement as I would think fair to say that they have been quite supportive of the PJ theory over the years (e.g., TVI).

Outside Portugal, I can remember Mr Amaral being interviewed in 2009 on a show broadcast on "Europe 1", a national French radio channel (English transcript can be read here: http://frommybigdesk.blogspot.pt/2009/05/jacques-pradel-on-europe-1-with-goncalo.html). In this show was also Georges Mor√©as, a famous former chief police officer who has been writing openly pro-PJ stuff for years in a blog hosted by the journal "Le Monde" (http://moreas.blog.lemonde.fr/author/moreas). This is way too little, but not completely insignificant. I don't know about other countries but these shy attempts at counterbalancing the official truth suggest, IMO, the embarrassment and sense of bad conscience that the Maddie case has created in the world of mainstream journalism...

Regarding Australia, I must confess that I am ignorant about what the media are currently saying. It feels great to know that the brainwashing is coming to an end in some regions of the world! Could you please suggest some links on relevant press releases?
