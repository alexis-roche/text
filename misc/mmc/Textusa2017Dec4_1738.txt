Hello Textusa,

Another great post that really helps understanding this very sick game. If I understand well, the ex-boss of a child protection agency, the same guy who recently went on TV to advise the Police to recruit paedophile hunters, was using paedophiles to try and manipulate people in the Maddie case... This is more and more impressive!

About paedophilia, do you think that "assumed paedophilia" could have been an additional motivation for the cover-up in the very beginning? I mean: if swinging was going on while children were present in the resort, and if one child died violently, then it would have been difficult to keep the general public from making an association with paedophilia, even if it did not happen. The people present in the resort would then have been exposed as swingers and possibly suspected of paedophilia... probably all too much. Just an hypothesis.
