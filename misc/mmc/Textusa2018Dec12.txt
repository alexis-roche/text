Maybe not a good idea indeed to bring on reverse image searching once again...

I just did a google image search based on the n-tv.de picture (allegedly published on April 30, 2017). It only returned two sites, in addition to www.n-tv.de, linking to images with same size (1280 x 853):

http://ocean.badgenot.site/ocean-club-praia-da-luz-algarve/

It turns out that these images are stricly identical to the n-tv one in the sense that their color values are exactly the same at each and every pixel. They are therefore strict copies of the same file.

The Frog's picture, however, has the same image size but slightly different pixel values here and there although this is hardly perceptible by eye. Consequently, either it was downloaded from one of these sites but was processed (can't see any reason for this), or it comes from a different source -- an image missed by google images, or not present on the internet. Make your mind.

Note that the search also returned several pages from flash.pt linking to lower resolution images (828 × 523) so the Frog's picture was definitely not downloaded from those.

All the Frog has to do to clarify the situation is to provide the URL from where she downloaded the image.

It is quite ironical (to say the least) that several anti-Textusa commentators are now so desperate that they are bringing on Gonçalo Amaral to try and disprove Textusa.

Although GA has said that there was evidence of negligence, he has never said that Maddie died because of negligence. He considered in his book the HYPOTHESIS that Maddie could have died around 9pm by falling off the couch after Gerry went to do his alleged check. But the only conclusion he comes to with certainty is that "The minor, Madeleine McCann died inside apartment 5A of the Ocean Club in Vila da Luz, on the night of May 3rd 2007".
