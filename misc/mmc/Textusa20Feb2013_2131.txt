Textusa,

Finding out who had/has the control is what makes it relevant to keep on discussing this case. There is nothing we can do to bring Madeleine back. Even telling the truth will never render the justice she has been denied, or clear the disrespect she has been hold in for so long. But discussing the case can at least help us understanding in which world we are leaving.

I will be reading your next posts with pleasure.

Best,

Alex
