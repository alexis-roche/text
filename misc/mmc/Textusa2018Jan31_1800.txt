Please let me add to the above that I believe the reason for writing "Uncontaminated or contaminated by living" in the Table to be simply that the authors did not want to imply that false positives can only arise from uncontaminated samples. The fact that no false positive from contaminated samples was observed (if my interpretation is correct) is an outcome of the experiment that must not be confused with an a priori assumption. By doing this, they stress that false positives from live scent may occur in other experiments.
