Excellent rebuttal, Textusa. Just factual, as always, and certainly a good entry point to those who find it hard to read your blog. Also, the fact that you now run into the surprising "swinging not big enough" argument is a sign that you have made it very difficult to dismiss your thesis as some conspiracy theory. And that's already a huge achievement!

One point that IMO deserves clarification (and that you will probably address soon) is: how essential was the cover-up of Maddie's death to the one thing that really mattered, i.e. covering up the swinging? You stated several times that you believe the initial attempt to cover up Maddie's death to be some awkward decision made in the aftermath of the tragedy, which then went out-of-control of the "deciders" (sorry if I misunderstood). Do you think that the abduction scenario was imposed on the T9 by the said "deciders", or that the idea came from the T9 and that the "deciders" simply allowed it and provided some minimal assistance to implement it? In the latter case, what was the motivation of Gerry to take part in this?
