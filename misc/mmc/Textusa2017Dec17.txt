The "torturous police" card reminds me of a "documentary" on Maddie broadcast in October 2007 by "13e rue", a French TV channel owned by NBCUniversal. I remember that the program, presented by the locally (in)famous sensational journalist Karl ZÃ©ro, heavily emphasized the Cipriano allegations and presented M. Amaral as a tough cop to say the least. Very partial journalism but more subtle a card to play than the plain stupid police card, which was UK media's favorite at the time.

I do wonder, however, how this will play out in 2017 knowing that since then Leonor Capriano was condemned for false accusations (if I am not mistaken). Everything would rest upon Malinka's claim... but not sure torture allegations against the Portuguese Police best serve Portugal's interest at the moment.
