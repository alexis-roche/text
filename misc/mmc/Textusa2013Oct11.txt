The paper that Wendy Murphy wrote in 2009 in the Patriot Ledger exposes, even if presented as speculation, the most devastating theory for the McCanns that I have ever come across. Even some of the fiercest anti-McCanns may hope that none of this is true.

So, when Fox News invite her to comment live on the latest clutter release in the Maddie case, do they REALLY expect her to go about saying: "yes, that's great news, at least some hope to find Madeleine alive, remember the Castro case, bla bla"?

I would speculate that they don't - because it would take so much incompetence to make this mistake that it seems impossible not to do it deliberately.

Does that mean that we are witnessing the beginning of a new media war in this case? It's probably too early to tell, but this does not appear to be an uncontrolled incident. What role is Ruppert Murdoch now playing in this?
