Textusa,

Do you believe that the PJ knew in 2007 about the swinging going on in OC? I would imagine that such activities, which seemed to involve many locals, could hardly be kept top secret, especially in such a small town as PdL where rumors easily spread out. Also, swinging events might have occurred several times at OC prior to May 2007, and were legal anyway so did not need to be hidden from the Police at all cost - before Maddie's disappearance. But they then became even more difficult to hide when OC was under investigation.

The fact that Gon√ßalo Amaral never mentioned swinging publicly does not mean that he ignored about it and/or that he failed to see a connection with the case. His silence on this topic could also be motivated by his understanding that the level of retaliation would escalate by orders of magnitude if he spoke out in public.

Just an educated guess. Thanks in advance for sharing your opinion on this.

Alex
