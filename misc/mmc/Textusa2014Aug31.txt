Thank you for your reply. Well, I don't think I went as far as saying that PdL swingers were showing off. The gardener might not have been aware, but is it possible that no one among the OC staff never had even a slight suspicion? I would find it very surprising... but, yes, I am speculating here.

However, I should correct what I said about Mr Amaral never mentioning swinging publicly. In fact, he clearly associated Murat with swinging in his book (Chap. 7) when mentioning his open relationship with a married woman living with her spouse.
