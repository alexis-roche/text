What I meant precisely is that, if the same experiment was replicated (same experimental design, dogs with similar training and experience, etc. ), some false positives from live scent may be observed. At least, the authors have no basis to reject this possibility.

Again, this is my interpreation of their text. But, for sure, they did not mean to speculate on what how the dogs behave under different experimental conditions.

Unfortunately, I don't know anything about this particular subject and cannot direct you to other studies of interest.
