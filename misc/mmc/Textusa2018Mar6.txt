Textusa, don't you think that Gemma O'Doherty has unwittingly helped this "paedo offensive"?

It is a disturbing coincidence that her name is strongly associated with the Mary Boyle case, in which she quite openly supported the theory that the murderer was a paedo protected by the Irish establishment. This fact has unavoidably led the public to make a mental association between both cases.

Some of the tweets she sent in January suggest that she may sincerely believe that both cases are related to paedophilia. Could it be the reason why she was "picked" to write a "truthful" article about the Maddie case before realizing that she had been played? I know you have presented a slightly different interpretation, in which the "other side" did not have the initiative, but this coincidence is rather strange considering the current Insane's surge.
