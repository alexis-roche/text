Thank you for your answers to my questions.


I am not sure what you mean by: “the body became undifferentiated very soon after the "discovery"”. My understanding of your theory on the body disposal is that a very distressed Gerry decided to take dead Maddie to the streets of PdL with the intent to throw her at sea. I assume that he knew that the body would likely be found in the following days, but the autopsy would not rule out murder by a fictional abductor. Gerry on his way to the beach does nothing to avoid crossing with the Smith family, then feels some sort of panic, decides to throw his daughter in a trash bin, and quickly returns to OC. The body is taken by the garbage collectors next day or so, and incinerated without anyone noticing. Am I understanding correctly? 


Regarding the political role of UK, basically you are saying that the case has been deadlocked for 11 years because some high-ranking British leaders were initially fooled by the abduction staging and could not admit it. Correct too?

Please let me ask you some questions so I can make sense of the "precis".


How do you explain the dog alerts in the car rented three weeks later?


"Simple and expedient" disposal, "no movement at a later date": why then was the body never found in your opinion?


What do you think were the reasons for the UK government to interfere with the investigation (unless you don't believe such interference occurred)?


###################


Of course, he did not use the word “abduction”. These people use diplomatic language.


For an ambassador, to say that UK Police liaison officers are going to be sent “to help and support the family” has huge implications IMHO. You be the judge.


The simple fact that he spoke to the media on that day is significant per se, isn’t it?


Here is a link you probably found already:

###################
What is xenophobic in stating the obvious fact that the British authorities forced the Portuguese justice into the abduction scenario? Please watch again the media conference of British Ambassador John Buck on May 4 2007, in the hours following the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. Watch it again and again. Doesn't it say very clearly that UK considered abduction as the only acceptable line of inquiry? Wasn’t that an official statement that anyone who would lie in favor of the abduction scenario would be placed under the protection of UK? 


############################
"One does not cover up something by exposing it to MORE scrutiny."
Well, there is an old mass manipulation principle known as distraction strategy.
While the news were all about the disappearance of Maddie, no one was interested in what else could have been going on in Praia da Luz.
###############################
It shows that the abduction story was not their decision, and that it was not made in order to protect them against charges of manslaughter. 


Maybe the coincidence of Maddie dying by accident while DP and KM were the only adults present in the flat was enough concern. The police would ask why, where Gerry was at the same time

Your contribution to truth and justice has been very significant, I hope it will be decisive at political level. It has already had influence, no wonder. 


With the help and tennis post, you are placing the final piece of the puzzle into place. I also got into this case after coming across Amaral’s book during summer 2008, but have failed for years to realize the importance of David Payne’s statement.






###################################
Textusa, don't you think that Gemma O'Doherty has unwittingly helped this "paedo offensive"?


It is a disturbing coincidence that her name is strongly associated with the Mary Boyle case, in which she quite openly supported the theory that the murderer was a paedo protected by the Irish establishment. This fact has unavoidably led the public to make a mental association between both cases.


Some of the tweets she sent in January suggest that she may sincerely believe that both cases are related to paedophilia. Could it be the reason why she was "picked" to write a "truthful" article about the Maddie case before realizing that she had been played? I know you have presented a slightly different interpretation, in which the "other side" did not have the initiative, but this coincidence is rather strange considering the current Insane's surge.

Salut Vincent,


Merci encore et toujours pour tes messages si encourageants. Penser que mes chansons sont "magiques", ça me fait super plaisir même si, pardon, ça me parait irréel... Mais je continue grâce à des retours comme les tiens, dont je ressens la sincérité. Ça fait 4 ans que je continue, parce que mon idée initiale en arrivant ici était juste de poster quelques démos faites pour le fun, à l'intention de quelques vieux potes à moitié perdus de vue, avant de repartir dans mon quotidien. Et puis voilà... depuis 4 ans, je me prends pour un artiste, je pense presque chaque jour à la prochaine chanson, je m'emploie pour qu'elle soit meilleure que la précédente. C'est un peu fou, et il y a des gens autour de moi qui doivent se dire que j'ai fondu un plomb. Ils ont sans doute raison. Mais peu importe, je vis ça comme une belle aventure, sans savoir où elle va me mener. Peut-être que je me réveillerai un jour en me disant que je suis ridicule et qu'il est temps d'arrêter. Ça me travaille parfois, je t'avoue. Mais j'essaie d'évacuer ce genre de pensëes.


Hier je me suis fait une séance Prince sur youtube. C'était sans doute ma plus grande idole quand j'avais 15-20 ans, ce qui prouve que j'étais un ado de bon goût parce que j'aurais pu être fan de U2 à la place :) Et, là, en réécoutant ces trucs pour la première fois depuis bien longtemps, je me suis dit qu'il n'y a plus grand-chose à inventer après des mecs comme Prince parce qu'ils ont déjà tout fait. C'est ça, le vrai problème de l'industrie musicale, en fait, beaucoup plus que l'internet, le téléchargement, etc.: c'est qu'il n'y a pas eu de vrai renouvellement artistique depuis 25 ans.

Textusa, 


To make sure that I am not getting lost in the discussion, is there an agreement that the false positives reported in the Oesterhelweg et al paper all originated from uncontaminated samples? 


That is my understanding. It would imply that the dogs never reacted to live blood in these particular experiments - correct? 


As to why K gave false positives, the authors did not venture into any explanation. However, from Table 1, we can infer that K performed 23 searches and, considering that “Every sixth search was carried out without any contaminated material” (section 2), it can be deduced that K gave at least one positive signal in every search. Speculating, could it be that K felt compelled by the experimental protocol to find something in every search? It does not explain the remaining ‘10 min’ false positive, though, but casts some doubt on the likelihood of ‘uncontaminated’ false positives in real-world situations.




##########################################


Don’t you think that swinging was a plausible *initial* reason to simulate an abduction? The “big hitters” could have the Portuguese police under control with some appropriate political help, but what about the media? Who knows if some Portuguese journos would not find out about the swinging event and leak some names in the local press? Who is powerful enough to prevent that? Such scoop, even unlikely, would then be taken up in the UK and surely be devastating for some reputations, even more so if associated, loosely or not, with the death of a little girl, accidental or not.


In this scenario, the simulated abduction would be part of a quickly decided fallback strategy in the aftermath of Maddie’s death, the main goal of which was to exfiltrate some relevant people “incognito”. It is also possible that the McCanns accepted to play their role in the story on the promise of some kind of reward for being “helpful”, despite having *initially* nothing serious to fear on the judicial level. This would partly explain their pretty arrogant attitude.


Once the initial panic moment had passed, the motivation for the cover-up changed as a consequence of what this blog has called a “snowball effect”. With the PJ being less controllable than expected, there was some pressure to let the truth out, and that was probably possible without exposing the swinging, but not without exposing many people involved in the cover-up itself. And all this further escalated over time, with the government finally putting the whole reputation of UK on the line with Operation Grange… Bloody dogs!


BTW, this is personal speculation. My view is clearly influenced by this blog, but may not be endorsed by the blog team.


###############################
I did not speculate on what would have happened if the authors had used more uncontaminated samples. What I said is the false positive count would have remained the same if they had added CONTAMINATED samples (contaminated with deceased tissue). That is not speculation, neither it is in any way a judgment about their experimental design, it's just stating a fact. And I maintain that the reported specificity of 91% corresponds to a false positive rate of 9% as per the definition of specificity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity).


For the rest, we are in agreement.
###############################
PUBLISH IF YOU WANT.


I don’t want to go into a technical fight, because I really think that the bulk of your reasoning is correct.


We agree that my assumptions are not minimally realistic, they correspond to a very unfavorable scenario. I think we also agree that, even in such very unfavorable scenario, there is no way that an ERVD dog can mark multiple locations. I did overlook several aspects that should indeed be taken into account: contamination time, simultaneous markings of ERVD & Blood dogs, ... and would further decrease the probability down to a very, very small number. I am talking about the probability of marking several locations IF there is no cadaver trace at all (regardless of whether there is blood of a live human being or not).


However, re the 3% vs 9% as a worst-case estimate of the false positive rate, I respectfully disagree with your calculation because the experimental “universe” contained samples contaminated with deceased tissue, which, by definition, do not impact the false positive rate. If the dog had been presented with more of those, the number of false positives would have been the same (4) and the false positive rate would remain the same too. Please remember that I work under the assumption that there was no cadaver trace at all in the crime scene, and evaluate (in a basic and conservative way) to which extent this assumption is contradicted by the evidence.


###############################


Sorry to be picky, but according to the article, the specificity of K in Table 3 was 91%, which corresponds to a 9% false positive rate, right? However, even assuming 10% in the worst-case scenario, the probability of two false alarms would be 1%, the probability of three would be 0.1%, and so on... so your argument remains completely valid.


#################################


Gemma O’Doherty has twitted that Maddie was “failed utterly” by the police. It looks like Gonçalo Amaral agrees with that according to an interview he gave to CM last year:


https://joana-morais.blogspot.pt/2017/04/goncalo-amaral-there-was-far-too-much.html


These words about the direction of PJ seem particularly relevant:


“You do not get rid of a senior police officer to defend a couple suspected at the very least of child neglect, which led to the disappearance. It was almost a lack of respect to make the decision that it was an abduction and make it public. That was not looking at the investigation objectively. If this investigation ever comes to an end and if it proves that the parents have nothing to do with the case, that's fine.”


##############################


Hi Textusa,


Trying to anticipate a "tornado" scenario from Gemma's investigation, do you see any possibility to have the McCanns brought to justice without exposing Operation Grange as a long-term farce?


##############################


Was the "Malinka's stunt" aimed to promote the neglect/abduction theory or only to discredit the police without promoting any particular theory?


##############################


I do hope that you are right about Gemma O’Doherty being absolutely independent. If so, her investigation can only serve the Truth. However, so few journalists have shown independence in the Maddie case that it might be preferable to remain agnostic on this matter until we get to know more from Mrs O’Doherty.


################################


Interesting that Tony Blair seems to be on target. Could this relate to his political comeback and anti-Brexit positions? 


I respect your decision but my comment was by no means a personal opinion about Brexit. It was an open question about the current game, which seems to have political implications and be related to Brexit by your own admission.


################################
The “torturous police” card reminds me of a “documentary” on Maddie broadcast in October 2007 by “13e rue”, a French TV channel owned by NBCUniversal. I remember that the program, presented by the locally (in)famous sensational journalist Karl Zéro, heavily emphasized the Cipriano allegations and presented M. Amaral as a tough cop to say the least. Very partial journalism but more subtle a card to play than the plain stupid police card, which was UK media’s favorite at the time.


I do wonder, however, how this will play out in 2017 knowing that since then Leonor Capriano was condemned for false accusations (if I am not mistaken). Everything would rest upon Malinka’s claim… but not sure torture allegations against the Portuguese Police best serve Portugal’s interest at the moment.


######################
Hello Textusa,


Another great post that really helps understanding this very sick game. If I understand well, the ex-boss of a child protection agency, the same guy who recently went on TV to advise the Police to recruit paedophile hunters, was using paedophiles to try and manipulate people in the Maddie case... This is more and more impressive!


About paedophilia, do you think that "assumed paedophilia" could have been an additional motivation for the cover-up in the very beginning? I mean: if swinging was going on while children were present in the resort, and if one child died violently, then it would have been difficult to keep the general public from making an association with paedophilia, even if it did not happen. The people present in the resort would then have been exposed as swingers and possibly suspected of paedophilia... probably all too much. Just an hypothesis.


***********************************


Did Mr Sócrates ever commented on the sending of “British Police liaison officers” to Portugal in the hours following Maddie’s disappearance? I always puzzled why he was never publicly questioned about that (if I am not mistaken).


Maybe, again, he never discussed the issue with Tony Blair at the time, and therefore has nothing to do with that decision. 


That would make him a puppet PM back in 2007. Or, maybe, just a liar. Either way, possibly not the most influential character in this whole saga, but certainly one of the most pathetic ones, who fully deserved this humble tribute paid by Textusa.


→


You must be talking about the political pressure that UK put on Portugal from the very beginning of this case.


Besides, I don't see what kind of political pressure can arise from the disappearance of a child, however tragic, sad and revolting it is. Let's not confuse media pressure with political pressure (in this case, I believe that the former was used to increase the latter).


We might never get to know why Mr Sócrates bowed so easily to that pressure. He might have thought at the time that it was a small diplomatic favor which would go almost unnoticed. But he will be remembered as the Portuguese PM who enabled political interference in the Maddie case and indirectly hindered the course of justice. 




*********************************
You touch upon a key question that is to me the main mystery in this whole case: why has the Portuguese state collaborated in this cover-up for 10 years now, with three successive governments (if I am not mistaken)? How good can it be for Portugal to be regarded as a submissive country that has blatantly put its police and judicial system under the tutelage of UK, and for what results? What is the next step now, Portugal sentenced by the ECHR?


So, Theresa May is the one and only person on earth who can put an end to this farce, is that correct? But what if 


It could be that a majority of people in UK perceive this attitude as “normal”, but for other Europeans 


seems to be still waiting for the orders coming from ? 


A probably naive question: in the long run, when UK is out of EU, what will be the motivation for Portugal to

Just as a little reminder, if you plan to go to Portugal this summer, do not forget to bring rape whistles along. Always watch out paedophiles, burglars and human trafficking gangs lurking in the street. Keep the phone numbers of some journalists to call in the very likely event that you are victim of a crime or witness one - do NOT call the police, for your own safety. However, if you plan to dine out and get hammered while leaving your kids alone in your rented flat, and are concerned that you might not find the bloody key when you come back, remember that in Portugal it is considered within the bounds of responsible parenting to leave doors unlocked in such circumstances. Enjoy your holiday!




********************************************


Maybe it is because I am watching at it from a non-UK perspective, but I find it hard to believe that the public can buy the fresh BS from the Sun and co. This is becoming totally nonsensical. Details like the rape whistles are beyond absurdity, can it fool anyone on earth? People cannot be THAT stupid.


So it sounds a bit like the UK tabloids are now telling people: hey, wake up, we have been fooling you for ten years, now it’s time you forget everything you think you know about the Maddie case. And maybe prepare for a twist.


********************************************




“Since late Sept 2007, no media in the world has published anything TRUTHFUL against the McCanns, or to be precise linking the McCanns to Maddie’s death, until now, in Australia.”


I assume that you are you excluding the Portuguese media from this statement as I would think fair to say that they have been quite supportive of the PJ theory over the years (e.g., TVI). 


Outside Portugal, I can remember Mr Amaral being interviewed in 2009 on a show broadcast on “Europe 1”, a national French radio channel (English transcript can be read here: http://frommybigdesk.blogspot.pt/2009/05/jacques-pradel-on-europe-1-with-goncalo.html). In this show was also Georges Moréas, a famous former chief police officer who has been writing pro-PJ stuff for years in a blog hosted by the journal “Le Monde” (http://moreas.blog.lemonde.fr/author/moreas). This is very weak, but not completely insignificant. I don’t know about other countries but these shy attempts at counterbalancing the official truth suggest, IMO, the embarrassment and sense of “bad conscience” that the Maddie case has created in the world of mainstream journalism...


Regarding Australia, I must confess that I am ignorant about what the media are currently saying. It feels great to know that the brainwashing is coming to an end in some regions of the world! Could you please suggest some links on relevant press releases?




Being French, I have to say that the general attitude of the French media has been appalling in the Maddie case, generally relaying the UK propaganda. There were, however, a couple of exceptions. Georges Moréas, a famous former chief police officer, has been writing on a blog supporting for years the thesis of Maddie’s death and body concealment in a blog hosted by “Le Monde”. Both Amaral and Moréas were invited in 2009 on a 


Outside Portugal, I can remember Gonçalo Amaral talking on “Europe 1”, a leading French radio channel  (see English transcript of the show:  http://frommybigdesk.blogspot.pt/2009/05/jacques-pradel-on-europe-1-with-goncalo.html). In the same show appeared Georges Moréas 








These are small things, but not completely insignificant, and I would be surprised if similar things have not happened in other countries. In my opinion, it just shows that the Maddie case created a lot of embarrassment and a sense of “bad conscience” among journalists. Some of them reacted to that, yet in a very lame way. 




************************************************************
The UK Police committed themselves to the thesis that Ben Needham died accidentally, but could hardly be more ambiguous about the circumstances of the accident. Plus their credibility was instantly trashed by the media voicing very loudly harsh criticism coming from both families. It looks like a stage.


******************************************************
Please let me ask a truly appalling question: do you think that if Madeleine McCann died following paedophile acts rather than accidentally, the whole cover up would not have taken place?


Not saying that paedophilia happened (hopefully not!), but I fail to see why it is incompatible with the swinging theory.


Also, if paedophilia was used as a red herring, why was Payne targeted? Why point so close to the truth?


*************************************************************************************
Thank you for your answers.


Please note that I am not, in any way, putting swinging and paedophilia in the same category, just considering the possibility that someone in that group could have engaged in both activities. Arthur Rimbaud was both a great poet and a weapons dealer, two qualities that obviously do not fall in the same category.


One strong argument against paedophilia in the Maddie case is that it suggests a murder (involving premeditation), which we certainly agree is implausible. However, I am wondering about the reasons we have to rule out paedophilia without the intention to kill.


Regarding "the amount of people we see have witnessed being involved", how many of them knew the exact circumstances in which Madeleine McCann died? Many probably understood that it was a violent death: that did not prevent them from taking part in the cover-up. By doing so, they not only covered up a peccadillo, they also protected manslaughter against a child and obstructed justice at different degrees.


That said, I am fully convinced by the main message of your post: that paedophilia was not the big secret to protect. And, frankly, I lean towards your interpretation that the Gaspard statement was a red herring. But I can imagine that the fear of being associated with paedophilia, be it real or not, was among the initial motivations for the cover-up. 


*************************************************************************************
Just an hypothesis, but what if the “third option” was the goal of Operation Grange from the beginning? In 2011, the UK government realized that the official abduction theory had lost too much credibility due, in particular, to the wide awareness of the sniffer dog evidence. They might then have appointed SY to come up with a new theory accounting for the dog markings, with the intent to put an end to the Maddie media frenzy. To be “minimally inconvenient”, the new theory would have to be a mere update to the 2007 abduction scenario, in which no protagonist was seriously compromised. The only realistic solution fulfilling this constraint was to have Maddie killed in the apartment, then taken, by a mysterious intruder.


The extreme slowness of Operation Grange suggests that SY met more difficulties than expected in completing this task. Perhaps the Portuguese authorities were not happy about the proposed scenario. Perhaps the activity on the blogosphere (also partly revived by the launching of Operation Grange) raised some concern. But October 2013 BBC Crimewatch was quite clear that SY were not up for the truth. It rather proved their determination to manipulate opinion in the crudest way with the Crèche Dad fabrication, although they did subtly leave the door open to Amaral’s “minimalist” theory - body concealment by the McCanns alone - maybe the “B plan”?


Who knows what SY are up to at the moment. As pointed out in the post, time is not a friend of third option when it comes to biology, but time may tire many of the beautiful souls eager for truth and justice, thereby increasing the chances of promoting abduction 2.0 in the long run. This might be the current strategy: attrition warfare. To just let all of us get tired and give up.


I hope to be wrong on this. That would mean that we still need to be very, very patient to see the truth prevailing one day.

Number 8:


"Go back. Consider just what we know. Ignore all of the following : government interference [...]"


The one thing that we can assert we know about this case is that there was political interference. It's no conspiracy theory, it just happens to be obvious from the facts. 


Forget about the DNA tests, the phone calls by Gordon Brown, the connections of Clarence Mitchell... just watch the declaration of British ambassador John Buck on May 4th 2007, in the hours following Maddie's disappearance. It's available on youtube. What does this man say? Among other things, he says that British Police liaison officers are to come from Leicestershire down to Portugal. 


Does an ambassador have the power to make such a decision? No.


Is it common to send foreign Police forces on site in a tragic, yet ordinary, criminal investigation? No. Even with lots of journalists around.


Was it requested by the Portuguese PJ? Not at all, see Amaral's book for instance. 


So, again, who requested that action? And who had the power to implement it? 


Isn't it obvious?

Letter to textusa


Hi Textusa, 


I recently came across your Theory by chance. I have been quite interested in the Maddie case for a while (and I did read Amaral’s book in 2008) but have only checked the internet occasionally on this topic - and didn’t know your blog up to now... better late than never. 


At first, I was fairly convinced by the scenario you proposed but then several objections crossed my mind and I thought I would share them. If you are really seeking the truth, it is reasonable to assume that you are open to discussion. 


1. Your core hypothesis is that the reputation of Gordon Brown was at stake at a particularly bad time. But why then encouraging a massive media exposure of the case? The more journalists around, the more likely someone will dig in the dirt - and promiscuous behavior is the kind of things that cannot remain wholly secret. Would anything be found, some political opponent would be very tempted to exploit it. Part of the British press would be under control, but not the whole international press. So why not simply trying to choke the case? Socratès could certainly help for that. 


2. According to your scenario, only Kate McCann and David Payne are responsible for Maddie’s death legally speaking, so they could be the only ones facing criminal prosecution. Why would the others, including Gerry, help covering up *their* murder? One thing is to be involved in a sex scandal, another thing is to be accomplice of murder and evidence destruction. Would Gerry take the lead of a massive cover-up just to protect his wife and keep his reputation clean? On the other hand, his daughter died and he did nothing illegal. I could see him telling a couple of lies to the Police but not beyond that, unless he loves his wife so much he would do anything to get her out of trouble (which doesn’t seem to fit his personality, does it?). My gut feeling is that he was more personally involved in Maddie’s death. 


3. Your theory does not account for a series of health-related facts that I find very disturbing: the PJ did not find any medicine in Appartment 5A (not even paracetamol...), they were never granted access to Madeleine's medical records, the McCanns looked very tense on TV when they denied sedating their kids... You may argue that these are red herrings. 


If the reputation of a top politician was at stake, it seems to me that the last thing spin doctors would have done is to encourage a massive media exposure of the case in order to minimize the risk that some journalists may dig in the dirt. Clearly, nothing was done to divert the public attention from Maddie’s disappearance - actually, the story may well have trashed the all-time world record of the highest media coverage for a missing child. This makes me skeptical about the assumption that the McCanns and their friends might have been part of a swinger network including Gordon Brown or whatever public figure the government was trying to protect.

Censored comment on joana-morais (13/1/11)


An involvement of the pharmaceutical industry is plausible in the light of the fact that the PJ has never been granted access to Madeleine's medical records. Was that to conceal leads to some kind of dubious medication?


Also, it is worthwhile taking a look at this excerpt from the Madeleine Foundation's letter to David Cameron in October 2010
(http://www.mccannfiles.com/id338.html):


"[...] it is understood that one of the major investors in the FSS, who, we are informed, did the analysis of the DNA and other evidence in the Madeleine McCann investigation, is a company called 3i. It is understood that 3i is a private equity company with strong links to both Brian Kennedy and Control Risks Group, a company brought in to Praia da Luz in the first days after Madeleine McCann was reported missing and whose role in the matter has been very obscure. We understand that the major shareholder in Control Risks Group is 3i Equity plc, and that the Chairman of 3i is Baroness Sarah Hogg, sister-in-law of Mrs Justice Hogg who of course was the judge who made Madeleine McCann a Ward of the High Court 19 days after she was reported missing."

Comments to textusa’s “swinger theory”


I have just come across this “swinger theory” by chance and have found it intriguing. I realize that it might be slightly outdated and could have been adjusted since then - please point me to any page where further discussion took place. I am not a specialist of the Maddie case but I did read Amaral’s book in Portuguese when it was released in 2008, and remain especially curious about why the case arose so much political interference.


Although the theory clarifies a number of facts, I feel that that it does not quite click with some other observations, so I thought I could share a couple of objections:  


1. If the reputation of a top politician was at stake, it seems to me that the last thing spin doctors would have done is to encourage a massive media exposure of the case in order to minimize the risk that some journalists may dig in the dirt. Clearly, nothing was done to divert the public attention from Maddie’s disappearance - actually, the story may well have trashed the all-time world record of the highest media coverage for a missing child. This makes me skeptical about the assumption that the McCanns and their friends might have been part of a swinger network including Gordon Brown or whatever public figure the government was trying to protect. 


would suggest that the so-called spin doctors were confident that no compromising connections could be found between the McCann holidaymakers and the public figures they might have been protecting. 


2.

I'm still digesting what I saw, but I wish they hadn't called Jeremy Wilkins "Jeremiah" and hadn't used a blonde woman to play Tanner, it gave me an impression of amateurism and badly done "housework". This documentary had to be, needed to be absolutely flawless, and little details like those can be damaging, in my opinion, of course(who am I to point the finger, I know nothing of film-making, but...)

1055 Well done Dr. Eric Preston. Where were you when Dr. Harold Shipman really needed you? Videhttp://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/notorious/shipman/dead_1.html
“Shipman was a doctor for God’s sake” (you might have argued). I would trust that he was not brought to justice by (if I may quote you) “a bunch of dead brained working class coppers who couldn’t manage school, never mind university.”
“Gerry and Kate are completely, 100%, without a shadow of a doubt INNOCENT!!” . . . you stated. Interesting statement considering nobody apart from Kate and Gerry McCann are likely to really know whether they are 100% innocent or 100% guilty at this stage!
To summarise the facts as we know them: The McCann family of 5 went on holiday. They organised a tapas party with friends one evening and chose to leave their children unattended in an unlocked apartment for the duration. I would assume, the McCanns being doctors and reportedly responsible, that they were satisfied they could enjoy their evening uninterrupted and they considered their three children were safe from possible harm and safe from doing any damage to themselves . . . if Madeleine was alive from the outset.
Suddenly Madeleine disappeared. So what are the possible options?
1. Madeleine woke up, managed to get out of the unlocked apartment, got run over or picked up by someone in the street and vanished.
2. Someone walked into the unlocked apartment and abducted her.
3. She was sedated and died of an overdose. Not a far fetched assumption considering both parents were doctors and such an event would have put both their careers at stake. A solid motive for the parents to hide the fact.
4. She suffered some physical abuse or a self-inflicted accident in the parent’s absence that led to her demise. Also a solid motive for the parents, if they were responsible, to hide the fact.
In the aftermath, 46 minutes passed before the police were called. Most people would have called the police immediately, if for no other reason than to get help finding her as soon as possible . . . especially if abduction or the possibility that she got out on her own were an option. The next move was for the McCann parents to bring in the media in the biggest possible way. Perhaps to increase their chances of recovering Madeleine! Perhaps to create public support for their innocence! Perhaps to create a diversion to give them time to hide any evidence that needed hiding before they became suspect!
One other point on the media coverage. If Madeleine was abducted, the massive media coverage would have done more to encourage an abductor to dispose of evidence than to risk releasing her I would have thought.
To say they are 100% Innocent is very naive Dr. Preston.
One thing is certain, at the very least, the McCanns are totally guilty of neglecting their very young children for having left them unsupervised in an unlocked apartment. This in a country, like most Mediterranean countries, where families are mostly welcome to bring their children with them when they go out to dinner in the evening. They could also have enjoyed a family evening in the apartment or they could have hired a babysitter. I don’t think they are entirely impoverished.
The only thing that amazes me is that the twins, for their own safety, have not been taken into custody until the guilt or innocence of the parents has been established.

At last – some reasoned and well thought-out statements of fact regarding this freakish case !! Evrything laid out here by Dreyfus is irrefutable and begs a lot of answering.
The next thing that bothers me is Clarence Mitchell, what is he all about ? I may have missed a few things but why would anybody leave a £70,000.000 a year job to be the McCann’s “Campaign Manager ” ? ..so who is paying him now and how much is he getting ? Why do they need a “Campaign Manager ” anyway ? Neither is working at the moment so they could get off their collective backsides and organise stuff themselves, as do other parents of missing children. They have ( apparently ) inumerable friends and family who would – one supposes – be more than happy to do anything for them for nothing and would have enough collective intelligence to work out what to do for the best ….or would they ??
Gerry is categorically a liar as the “Youtube” clip showing him scratching his ear when asked about whether they had administered sedatives classicly shows. More parents than care to admit, have admnistered the odd dose of “Calpol” or “Tixylix Night-time” to get their children off to sleep, especially if they are a tad hyperactive, and – according to Kate’s own diary – these children were routinely “hysterical” or “hyperactive”…now there’s a surpirise !! they are three and two year olds what did she expect ? Being Doctors they no doubt had access to “something a bit stronger” so I have no doubt they DID administer something but whether or not that led to an accidental death I wouldn’t like to state. If it did, then the argument goes in a whole different and very sinister, direction.
One fact is alarmingly clear, the children were left alone in an unlocked apartment, how come The McCanns were so certain that any of them, let alone Madeleine, wouldn’t wake up and go searching for Mummy & Daddy and – knowing where the Tapas Bar was, why would they not go wandering outside and off in that general direction to look for them ? It makes you shudder and they STILL protest they are “innocent”, if nothing else they are absolutely, 100% guilty of negelct and screw all the arguments about them “being punished enough”, you or I would be dragged into Court and our children removed to a “place of safety” !!

My opinions exactly.
Clarence Mitchell resigned as director of the Central Office of Information’s media monitoring unit. (UK government’s marketing and communications agency) the day before he announced he was the new spokesman for the McCanns. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Mitchell )
As far as who is paying him is concerned: (Sept 18, 2007, Reuters). He [Clarence Mitchell] also said he was not being paid either by the McCanns or their support fund but that expenses were being met by one of the couple’s “generous financial backers”.
(Branson maybe? Whoever it is does not appear keen to go public on this, which, in my opinion, could indicate a less than enthusiastic desire to support the McCanns publicly in case they do turn out to be guilty. Of course if it transpires they are innocent, it would be good for some lucrative and profitable publicity and a great investment).
Whatever the case it would seem likely if not obvious they needed a ‘Campaign Manager’, specifically because the media appears to have gone somewhat cold on their support for the McCanns in the light of emerging evidence.
Mitchell’s job I suspect is to get the media back on track in support of the McCanns’ innocence, in the hope that in turn they can persuade the public to again revert to supporting them. Perhaps on the one part to put pressure on the Portuguese police to lay off the McCanns and on the other to see an increase in public donations.
The McCanns will of course be forever indebted to the “generous financial backers”. The question is what do the generous financial backers expect in return? Quite a lot I imagine since this appears to have become more of a money ‘thing’ than a ’solve the Madeleine disappearance thing’.




WENDY MURPHY: Dead little girls + drugs = suspicion of child porn


QUOTE


The Patriot Ledger
Posted Mar 28, 2009 @ 05:00 AM


When children die – and parents are potential suspects – we often talk about abuse and neglect.


But when sedatives are found in a child’s body or at a crime scene, we need to talk about something else, too...


Child pornography.


The FBI has long taught about the use of sedative drugs in the making of child porn. Benzodiazepines such as Valium and Klonopin – and cheap alternatives such as chloroform – are commonly used to keep kids calm. Many of these drugs also cause short-term amnesia such that the victim has little or no memory of the event when the drugs wear off. It’s scary to think that ANYONE would do such a thing to a child, but get this: According to the U.S. Attorney General, child porn is a multi-billion dollar industry and the people most likely to be making it are the victims’ parents.


This sick “industry” not only destroys innocent souls – it is a life-threatening “business” because the build-up of sedatives in kids’ bodies can cause deadly seizures. If we’re going to protect children from this scourge, we have to talk more openly about it, especially during high profile cases when millions of people are watching.


Take the following stories, for example, though it should be emphasized that we have not heard from law enforcement whether there is any correlation between the deaths of these little girls and child porn.


JonBenet Ramsey was a beautiful dyed-blonde 6-year-old when she was found dead in the basement of her home. The day her body was found, her parents hired criminal attorneys and refused to submit to separate police interviews. Three search warrants were issued for child porn, and while police said none was found in the home, we really don’t know the details of what if anything was found elsewhere – or why they were looking for child porn – because the files in the case are being withheld from public view. We DO know that undigested pineapple was found in the child’s stomach and we know that a bowl of pineapple found on the kitchen table was taken as evidence, presumably tested for the presence of drugs. But we don’t know the results because, again, the file is being hidden. We also know that the child had “chronic” vaginal injuries including an “eroded” hymen, which many experts say is evidence of prior ongoing sexual abuse. When the parents eventually agreed to be interviewed by police, they were asked at length about sedatives in the home, such as Xanax and Klonopin.


Caylee Anthony was a sweet little 2-year-old when she “went missing” from her home in Florida. Her body was later found and her mother stands charged with her murder, in part because she failed to report Caylee missing for more than a month, and then lied about the circumstances of her disappearance. Human decomposition was found in the trunk of her mother’s car – along with Caylee’s hair and traces of chloroform. Law enforcement officials said that photographs of Caylee had recently been deleted from her mother’s computer.


Maddie McCann was an adorable 4-year-old who “went missing” from her hotel room in Portugal while on vacation with her British parents. The child’s hair and human decomposition were reportedly found in the trunk of her parents’ rental car. Early news reports indicated Maddie had been sedated by her parents to keep her asleep in the hotel room while they socialized nearby. The parents hired criminal attorneys and, after Maddie’s mom was named a suspect, she refused to answer police questions.


I don’t know if these cases are related to child porn. 


But I’m certain of three things. 


1. Sedating victims is common. 


2. The most valuable child porn depicts young, cute kids. 


3. All three cases involve sedatives and young, cute kids. According to the federal government, demand for child porn has skyrocketed because of the Internet, and will continue to rise unless we do a better job recognizing and talking about the problem when we see it.


It won’t be easy – in part because this stuff happens in secret, but also because we resist thinking about things that don’t feel good – and let’s face it – it doesn’t feel very good to believe parents sell their children for sex and porn. 


But what’s more important? 


Children – or the comfort of our denial?

Could the emptiness of Mock-2 be an unavoidable consequence of SY trying to pursue two highly incompatible objectives: continue the cover-up and come up with a diplomatic solution that could be acceptable for Portugal?


It’s a sad but obvious reality that the reputation of Portugal has been seriously damaged in this story. The release of the PJ files might have been decided as a compensation measure and, I imagine, after quite some negotiations at government level between Portugal and UK. Then came the SY review, which certainly raised concern in Portugal and must have led the Portuguese government to warn its British counterpart that trashing the publicly available PJ investigation was not an option. This is at least what I expect. And let’s not forget that Portugal is a country with quite significant diplomatic influence.


So, what can SY possibly do? Take as many characters off the picture to strengthen the cover-up. Of course, as many as possible. But there are two characters they cannot remove without getting in significant conflict with the PJ investigation: G&K. So, shine the spotlight on them, at least for now.


I can’t see any piece of evidence presented in Mock-2 that contradicts the facts established by the PJ in any way. The “new timeline” is just a teaser. We have Crèche-Daddy as a rather fascinating add-on, but this leads SY to the same conclusion as reached by the PJ back in 2007, namely that Tanner did not spot an abductor. 


And we now have GA interviewed on ITV as a respectable man, politely saying that SY have followed the same path as PJ.
