Did Mr SÃ³crates ever commented on the sending of "British Police liaison officers" to Portugal in the hours following Maddie's disappearance? I always puzzled why he was never publicly questioned about that (if I am not mistaken).

Maybe, again, he never discussed the issue with Tony Blair at the time, and therefore has nothing to do with that decision.

That would make him a puppet PM back in 2007. Or, maybe, just a liar. Either way, possibly not the most influential character in this whole saga, but certainly one of the most pathetic ones, who fully deserved this humble tribute paid by Textusa.
