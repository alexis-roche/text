Please let me ask a truly appalling question: do you think that if Madeleine McCann died following paedophile acts rather than accidentally, the whole cover up would not have taken place?

I am not saying that paedophilia happened (hopefully not!), but I fail to see why it is incompatible with the swinging theory.

Also, if paedophilia was used as a red herring, why was Payne targeted? Why point so close to the truth?
