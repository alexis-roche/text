Yes, Gemma O'Doherty was almost completely truthful. But "almost" isn't really good enough.

To me, she seems to be walking in the footsteps of Sutton, Bilton and co, those characters who appeared in the version 2.0 of the hoax presenting themselves as fierce anti-McCanns to gain credibility and sympathy from the general public, and then going on stage to say essentially one thing: that the PJ investigation was rubbish.

If the PJ investigation was rubbish, then guess what the PJ files are. And if Mr Smith is only 60-80% sure that he saw Gerry McCann, then what is left against the McCanns? The obvious answer is: nothing. Zero. Nada.

Are we supposed to now support Gemma on Twitter and happily follow her into this dead end road? The trap seems so obvious that I even wonder if she is doing this deliberately.

I would like to be wrong.
