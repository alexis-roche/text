Could the emptiness of Mock-2 be an unavoidable consequence of SY trying to pursue two highly incompatible objectives: continue the cover-up and come up with a diplomatic solution that could be acceptable for Portugal?

It’s a sad but obvious reality that the reputation of Portugal has been seriously damaged in this story. The release of the PJ files might have been decided as a compensation measure and, I imagine, after quite some negotiations at government level between Portugal and UK. Then came the SY review, which certainly raised concern in Portugal and must have led the Portuguese government to warn its British counterpart that trashing the publicly available PJ investigation was not an option. This is at least what I expect. And let’s not forget that Portugal is a country with quite significant diplomatic influence.

So, what can SY possibly do? Take as many characters off the picture to strengthen the cover-up. Of course, as many as possible. But there are two characters they cannot remove without getting in significant conflict with the PJ investigation: G&K. So, shine the spotlight on them, at least for now.

I can’t see any piece of evidence presented in Mock-2 that contradicts the facts established by the PJ in any way. The “new timeline” is just a teaser. We have Crèche-Daddy as a rather fascinating add-on, but this leads SY to the same conclusion as reached by the PJ back in 2007, namely that Tanner did not spot an abductor.

And we now have GA interviewed on ITV as a respectable man, politely saying that SY have followed the same path as PJ.
