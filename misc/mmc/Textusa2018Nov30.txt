They clearly don't like that you went public about the incident, which only confirms that you are right - however difficult it must have been to make this decision. My best wishes to you and your family. We the Chinese readers are here because we are ridiculously optimistic, so thank you for keeping our hopes alive.

I was wondering what it means to Anne Guedes to "MadeleineMcCann" someone. It is Chinese to me (oops...). Could it be some coded language beside the very thick humour?
