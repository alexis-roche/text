You must be talking about the political pressure that UK put on Portugal from the very beginning of this case.

Besides, I don't see what kind of political pressure can arise from the disappearance of a child, however tragic, sad and revolting it is. Let's not confuse media pressure with political pressure (in this case, I believe that the former was used to increase the latter).

We might never get to know why Mr SÃ³crates bowed so easily to that pressure. He might have thought at the time that it was a small diplomatic favor which would go almost unnoticed. But he will be remembered as the Portuguese PM who enabled political interference in the Maddie case and indirectly hindered the course of justice.
