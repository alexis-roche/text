Thank you for your answers.

Please note that I am not, in any way, putting swinging and paedophilia in the same category, just considering the possibility that someone in that group could have engaged in both activities. Arthur Rimbaud was both a great poet and a weapons dealer, two qualities that obviously do not fall in the same category.

One strong argument against paedophilia in the Maddie case is that it suggests a murder (involving premeditation), which we certainly agree is implausible. However, I am wondering about the reasons we have to rule out paedophilia without the intention to kill.

Regarding "the amount of people we see have witnessed being involved", how many of them knew the exact circumstances in which Madeleine McCann died? Many probably understood that it was a violent death: that did not prevent them from taking part in the cover-up. By doing so, they not only covered up a peccadillo, they also protected manslaughter against a child and obstructed justice at different degrees.

That said, I am fully convinced by the main message of your post: that paedophilia was not the big secret to protect. And, frankly, I lean towards your interpretation that the Gaspard statement was a red herring. But I can imagine that the fear of being associated with paedophilia, be it real or not, was among the initial motivations for the cover-up.
