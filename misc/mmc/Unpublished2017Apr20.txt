Maybe it is because I am watching at it from a non-UK perspective, but I find it hard to believe that the public can buy the fresh BS from the Sun and co. This is becoming totally nonsensical. Details like the rape whistles are beyond absurdity, can it fool anyone on earth? People cannot be THAT stupid.


So it sounds a bit like the UK tabloids are now telling people: hey, wake up, we have been fooling you for ten years, now it's time you forget everything you think you know about the Maddie case. And maybe prepare for a twist.
