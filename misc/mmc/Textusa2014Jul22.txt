Textusa, am I right in concluding from Gonçalo Amaral's message yesterday on Facebook that he is very confident in winning the case, although he seems desperate about how slow the trial is?

Maybe it's me misreading his words and being overoptimistic but, from a naive perspective like mine (as I am no legal expert at all), it would indeed seem that the Lisbon Appeals Court decision back in October 2010 practically rules out the question of damages as it clearly states that "The contents of the book does not offend any of the applicants' fundamental rights" (source: http://joana-morais.blogspot.com/2010/10/lisbon-appeals-court-ruling.html). This seems to settle the question, doesn't it? Or is it that the Appeals Court ruling can still be overturned?

Is it unrealistic to assume that the McCann team have known since October 2010 that they cannot possibly win this case, and have just been playing tactics ever since to avoid the public humiliation of withdrawing the injunction? And to keep sticking in people's minds that the McCanns are being persecuted by the "disgraced policeman" whenever the case reappears in the media?

Anyway, my best wishes to Gonçalo Amaral. I just hope that he will be remembered worldwide as the admirable man he is. Best wishes to this blog too - definitely the most intelligent and enlightening source about the Maddie case.
