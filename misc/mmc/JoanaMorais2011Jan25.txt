Number 8:

"Go back. Consider just what we know. Ignore all of the following : government interference [...]"

The one thing that we can assert we know about this case is that there was political interference. It's no conspiracy theory, it just happens to be obvious from the facts. 

Forget about the DNA tests, the phone calls by Gordon Brown, the connections of Clarence Mitchell... just watch the declaration of British ambassador John Buck on May 4th 2007, in the hours following Maddie's disappearance. It's available on youtube. What does this man say? Among other things, he says that British Police liaison officers are to come from Leicestershire down to Portugal. 

Does an ambassador have the power to make such a decision? No.

Is it common to send foreign Police forces on site in a tragic, yet ordinary, criminal investigation? No. Even with lots of journalists around.

Was it requested by the Portuguese PJ? Not at all, see Amaral's book for instance. 

So, again, who requested that action? And who had the power to implement it? 

Isn't it obvious?
