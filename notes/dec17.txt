Currently, the main issue I am facing with template matching is the detection of relevant salient points. A simple strategy based on picking points with strong gradient magnitude (defined, e.g., from the intensity) works well with a uniform image background, but performs poorly with textured background (e.g. foil). 

I am back to a question I considered as soon as I started in CoVii, back in February 2017: what are good image features? Successive candidates considered throughout the history of computer vision are corners, Harris detectors, SIFT and SURF.
