*** What is deep learning?
* Representation learning

Compare with classical computer vision.

Corners, SIFT, SURF...
SIFT --> robot localisation, image stitching, tracking...
Histograms of Oriented Gradients --> human detection
Wavelet coefficients (local orientation) --> face recognition

*** Mathematical intuition
* Highly nonlinear function modeling
* Complexity through sequential compositions

*** Learning
* Discriminant learning = brute force
* Requires big data

*** Convolutional neural network
* Concepts
* Some history

CNN --> image classification

*** FCNN
* Efficient implementation of region-based classification
* Image segmentation using CNN

Example: food segmentation.

*** Object detection architectures

* Basic approach: R-CNN (= selective search + CNN) 
* Fast R-CNN = F-CNN + selective search (region proposal works on feature map to share computation)
* Faster R-CNN = Fast R-CNN with selective search replaced by region proposal network (RPN)
* R-FCN = position sensitive score maps instead of single score maps.
* Single short detector (SSD) = multiscale feature maps + default bounding box class scores

RPN is a CNN trained to classify object vs non-object using "anchor boxes".

Example: MobileNetSSD 

We need advanced architectures for object detection
Old approach: R-CNN 


*** Learning algorithm

Stochastic gradient descent, first-order, second-order, batches...
How do we make sure learning is effective?
Many saddle points, index of a saddle point (fraction of negative eigenvalues) correlates with error

Panda approach: "Babysitting the model" vs Caviar appraoch (parallel models)


*** Transfer learning

Do deep learning without big data.
Very common paradigm in industry.
Use common models: VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50

*** Tools

Programming frameworks:
 TensorFlow, Theano, Caffe, CNTK, Keras...

High level:
 Amazon SageMaker
 Google Cloud Datalab

Community tools:
 Kaggle.com


*** Applications
* Food recognition: illustrates plain CNN
* Food segmentation: illustrates F-CNN
* Person reidentification: illustrates SSD, CNN, and small data problems that cannot be solved using deep learning only...

*** Beyond supervised learning

Do we need big labeled datasets???
Unsupervised learning
Reinforcement learning
