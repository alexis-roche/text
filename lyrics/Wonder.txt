Wonder

Here we are now
Many miles away
And I wonder
If we should ever go back
Or just stay
Like in shelter
And forget gloomy days
Ooh babe I can feel this place
Felt it right away

And it feels like
Going back in time
Times of wonder
And sweetie music
Cycling through my mind
Life so mellow
Bright colors night and day
Ooh babe it's just the perfect place
To hide away
