A Simple Song
24.2.14

Is there something wrong about you?
Where is that funny grin on your face
That used to turn into a storm?
Well, it's just a simple song
Filled with simple questions

And now you claim that you found peace
That you got something going somewhere
And we'll just feel the air behind you
Why don't I buy your story
You've never been so true

And then you stare at me so calmly
And you smile so gracefully
Did you trip over your mirror?
Well, it's just a simple song
I should have played before
