Cold as ice

Bit by bit
Wave by wave
I'm fading
On the waterline
Catch my hand
Grip my soul
Before I drown
And get cold as ice

In my heart
In my mind
The stars are falling
So am I 
Fetch my dreams
Wipe my tears
Before I drown
And get cold as ice

I'm sinking and I don't want to hear
This singing whispered in my ears
The mermaids are running the show
And there I go I go...

Bit by bit
Wave by wave
You're fading
On the waterline
Catch my hand
Save your soul
Before you drown
And get cold as ice

In your heart
In your mind
The stars are falling
Wonder why
Fetch your dreams
Wipe your tears
Before you drown
And get cold as ice

You're sinking but you will get to hear
The singing whispered in your ears
The mermaids are ready for the show
And here you go you go...
