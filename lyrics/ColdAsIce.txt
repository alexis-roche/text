Cold as ice

Bit by bit
Drop by drop
I'm fading
On the waterline
Catch my hand
Grip my soul
Before I drown
And get cold as ice

In my heart
In my mind
It's only raining
No more sky
No more dreams
No more fears
Until I drown
And get cold as ice

I'm sinking and I don't want to hear
The singing whispered in my ears
The mermaids are running the show
And there I go I go...

Bit by bit
Drop by drop
You're fading
On the waterline
Catch my hand
Grip my soul
Before you drown
And get cold as ice

In your heart
In your mind
It's only raining 
No more sky
Fetch your dreams
Wipe your tears
Before you drown
And get cold as ice

You're sinking but you just have to hear
The singing whispered in your ears
To see through the rain the rainbow
And here you go you go...

[Wave by wave]

[The stars are falling
So am I]

[Save your soul]

[The stars are falling
Wonder why]
